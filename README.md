## AI-Powered Personal Finance Platform for LatAm

**Moni AI** is an AI-first personal finance platform designed for Latin America that helps people centralize all their financial accounts in one place, understand their money, and make better financial decisions with confidence.

We combine artificial intelligence, open banking, and behavioral finance to turn complex financial data into clear insights, actionable guidance, and better financial habits.

Our mission is to help millions of people **take control of their money**, regardless of how many banks, cards, or financial products they use.

Moni AI allows users to:

* Connect multiple bank accounts and cards in one place  
* See a unified, real-time view of their finances  
* Understand spending, income, and cash flow clearly  
* Learn how to manage money through AI-driven guidance  
* Build better financial habits over time

* **Account aggregation** – All bank accounts and cards in one dashboard  
* **Smart categorization** – Automatic expense and income classification  
* **Cash flow analysis** – Clear visibility into where money comes from and goes  
* **Personalized insights** – AI recommendations based on real behavior  
* **Financial education** – Learn to budget, save, and plan better  
* **Future-ready automation** – Foundations for savings, goals, and wealth tools

* **Secure** – Built with privacy and data protection by design
